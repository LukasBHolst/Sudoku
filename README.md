# Sudoku
## Short description
Backtracking algorithm and GUI

## Origin of idea and development (also changes to the code)
I like sudoku and saw a youtube video on a project that solves sudoku with a backtracking algorithm.

The backtracking algorithm contained in the Sudoku file is all implemented by me, using pseudocode located at: [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sudoku-backtracking-7/)

The GUI is heavily inpsired by the youtuber Tim, whose github can be found [here](https://github.com/techwithtim)

I revised the code a bit to implement multiple games, more buttons and maybe more functionality in the future.
I also reduced the amount of code pr. file by splitting the classes up into seperate files and importing them.
This could however be improved a bit further to avoid a many to many relation and make it look just a tad bit cleaner.

## Reason for the project
* I wanted to do this project since I find algorithms fun and fascinating to implement.
* Visualizations of algorithms are mesmerizing.
* I wanted to learn how to do object oriented programming in Python and how to make a GUI.
